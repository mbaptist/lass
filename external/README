The module vzdeigen provides the function vzdeigen to find the dominant eigenvalue of a linear operator, provided a vector and a function yielding the product of the operator by the vector, as external_prodx somewhere in the code that links with the library.

The product function must have the form
	external_prodx(NIT,VI,VO,M)
with the parameter defined in the wrapper below. Vectors are double precision.

c     Subroutine that interfaces with any externally supplied routine
c     to evaluate the product of the linear operator by the vector
c     NIT - current iteration
c     VI - Array with input vector
c     VO - Array with input vector
c     M - Size of the arrays


This module is just a wrapper and requires a third-party fortran source, not published, and for which you need the explicit permission of the author. To enable it, simply place the yuio.f file in the external folder, under the source tree, and rebuild the project.

The file yuio.f can be requested directly to the author, Vlad Zheligovsky (vlad@mitpu.ru).
